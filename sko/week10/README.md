Detailed statement 

This work is a reflection of ourselves as creators. We wrote a short story (currently in continuous creation) to discuss when creators are dominated by a strong desire for expression and get lost in the journey of hunger for inspiration. We visualized the discussion through the narrative video. When creators are obsessed with the illusion they have built, at the same time they are also using this way to shape their personal self-esteem. The creators of exaggerated narcissism have invested a lot of energy in enhancing their self-perceived superiority, and are very vigilant in their efforts to discover and spread the potential threats to their exaggerated self-perception. Fragile narcissists are not very good at using self-improvement strategies to regulate self-esteem, and often must rely on external feedback from others to manage self-esteem. They experience greater anxiety when developing relationships with others, are highly alert to separation clues, and experience greater pain during separation because of the fragile nature of their self-esteem. By creating the character image of the heroine Elena, we hope to build an image-a creator who devotes all her time and energy to her delusion and paranoia in the process of seeking inspiration, and use it as a means of taking the physical and psychological To explore another influence of creative desire: it becomes a fig leaf for the mediocre to her impetuous heart, and a catalyst to release various desires in her heart. For narcissistic creators who lack self-awareness and are not strong enough in their hearts, this desire for expression has become a weapon facing themselves; while creating layers of different masks for themselves, they are gradually lost in fantasy and get into orgasm. In fact, all these intense and contradictory emotions occur in the complex brain and mental activities of narcissistic creators. Such strong intuitions are often chaotic and cannot be described in words. Violence, sexual desire and moral panic, the desire for expression is like a wonderful catharsis, tempting narcissistic creators to become its slaves. When constructing the entire video structure, we will begin to pave the way for Elena’s personal career development and out-of-control creative desire, through several event nodes to promote Elena’s psychological defense and fantasy to gradually collapse, and finally to another kind in the ballroom. Extreme-she not only wants to destroy all the works (overly denying herself), but also to retaliate against all those involved (because she thinks they are the source of her narcissistic delusions). Creators also enjoy the pleasure of absolute freedom and dominance when constructing the world of their own works. When they cannot get this part of the satisfaction in the real world, it will often prompt her to double the desire and misunderstanding of her inner desires. We enhance the narrative sense of the video by constructing scenes of events and activities, and at the same time use surreal distorted human bodies and animations to visualize Elena's disintegrated self.

After written a simple storyline I started to build a prototype of the medieval ballroom, I searched lots of references of the real medieval history building but still struggled with the visual. Two voice fought in my mind ---- be more realistic? or more abstract? more surreal? or even they didn't have to stay in a specific 'ballroom'? What's the interior design style and what kind of furnitures and decorations would be appropriate with our storyline and characteristic?
