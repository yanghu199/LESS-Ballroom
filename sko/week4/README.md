week 4

We had so many diverse and variety perspectives form different group regarding the history and development tendency of collage. It’s impressive to comprehend and redefine the definition and boundary of collage - if it’s truly exist? Especially in the time I researched for 3d collage, I was confused with my judgement, and it’s so struggle that to categorize the virtual artifacts with the conventional standards. 

I was inspired by the collage with music because I found so many overlapped parts with my research yet they were emphasizing the music genre.  GEO created a sex symbolism record cover for a Hip-Hop album, which basically was an abstract combination of sex organ elements.

Travis scott collaborated to host an event on the popular video game fortnite back in 2020. This was a massive event which saw a whopping 12 million online players take part in the performance of his song sicko mode. This was an example of the two worlds of music performance and video gaming collaging together to create a really beautiful visual and thrilling performance.

When thinking about the cooperation with music industry, it's so easy for me to remind the 3d interactive website created by Nick Knight and Kanye. YEEZY SUPPLY, the e-commerce website of Kanye's fashion brand YEEZY. As early as 2013, when Kanye and Nike switched to adidas, he revealed to Nick his idea of a website. Of course, the entire Internet knows that he is very busy, and it wasn't until three years ago that they began to put website work on the table. On e-commerce websites, virtual models are an important role. Nick found that it is easy to buy 3D character models online, the effect is very rough, very in line with Kanye's Lo-Fi texture. Kanye chose a female image from them. He prefers the model's skin color and her shade to be just right, and he affectionately named her Becky. "I want to throw away all the black and white, I want to lose all the straight lines and borders, I want Monet's tones." The black and white colors that other fashion e-commerce companies are using, Kanye don't want it, he wants a softer and more Natural tones, like Monet's garden, are naturally carved. For example, the blue of the website background cannot be the ordinary blue, but the blue drawn from the sky and the sea. How to create a sense of no border in a rectangular web window? James Turrell, who is good at creating with space and light, is the best reference. The documentary "Jesus Is King" was shot at James Turrell's Volcano Observatory, and Kanye is also one of the observatory's sponsors. The countless explanatory texts on the e-commerce website, in Kanye's view, are completely inhumane. For Kanye, humanity comes first.

For my research to our 3d group, I selected one of my favourite creative studio Rodina's artwork and MMMAD – Festival for digital art, PLATESPACE - NFT platform as the samples of virtual 3d collage.

The Rodina design studio

Sweet Datapoint is an example of The Rodina’s impressive accomplishments. Sweet Datapoint consists of the video Captured by Success and three-metre high prints. The project is “dedicated to all who haven’t had sex since last year.” Tereza rendered large amounts of “frog eggs”, orgasmic skies and distorted heads with 3d collage. Intense, hard, refreshing and awkward are among the adjectives that Tereza used to describe the creative process. It was about sexuality. They tried to depict a space that lies somewhere in between the act of reproduction, passion and the erotic experience. I think Rodina studio try to re-imagine a dazzling range of layered meanings across their work with mix media collage, both below and beyond the 2d and 3d, surface of design — and back to real life again. Their fancy mixing material aesthetic video inspired me to play around with the 3d model and combine the real life video and 2d graphic components together.

MMMAD – Festival for digital art 
 
MMMAD festival for digital art took place in Madrid throughout May. For the second time, the organizers  turned Spain’s capital into a museum with 3d collage motion graphic design exhibited on screens, Instagram filters accessible with QR-Codes, and screenings of virtual reality films. The need to replace physical presence with virtual encounters freed the way for a futuristic presentation for artists. I think the festival clearly showed some truth with imagination leading artists to extend the reality with combining the 3d digital collage with 2d graphs and reality. It is essential to let the outside affect the individual, embrace experiences, and see where it leads us. In this case, 3d collage becomes a bridge that combine the purely digital world with reality, create the conversations between artists and audiences that around the world through internet.

I observed the original flowery pattern and found that it looked like a kind of pastel painting.

I finished it in 2019 with pastel, attempted to depict a Buddhist ceremony that I watched in Thailand. The only similar thing with this painting and original one might be just the vivid color.
