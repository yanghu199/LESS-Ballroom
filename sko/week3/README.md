week 3


After week 2 I started to hunt and collect my own image sources. Initially I focused on some artist books that I brought last month =>

<DEMO> => 'which is a book that discuss how to see design behaviour from the perspective of an authentic human being. And so-called authenticity could be accessed, only if we see through the spectacle created by the system and connect directly with the real world existing all along, namely nature.'
  
‘…individuals retain the freedom to renounce the certainties that imprison them within systems and to find the interstices where friendship and personal action remain possible…’

Many invisible buildings are distributed in the natural space on earth. They are data centers, cryptocurrency mines and so on. The buildings only accommodate machines, in need of much electric energy and a cooling environments. Some architectural theorists divide them into the category of architecture used by non-human, in the name of ‘Architectures of the Post Anthropocene.’ Thinking about them from the perspective of architecture, we firstly confront the issues concerning the energy, environment and public government. I started from the virtual currency boom to reflect on this kind of architecture, the architecture, the holding the virtual world of humans. The process made me question many times about why we built them.

According to the official website of Cryptovoxels , in this space, the user’s most basic function is to buy and sell land NFT, set up shops or galleries on their own land to display and trade NFT works of art, and other functions are to some extent for NFT trading services. Cryptovoxels is trying to build an economic system using blockchain. Compared with buying and selling artworks in galleries, the rise and fall of land prices are more in line with the economic laws of the real world. 

In the NFT blockchain planform, different artist places their virtual artefacts following the value of their land, which naturally generates an immense 3d combination collage. Collage in this virtual planform, is more like a display way for presenting these artworks rather than express a specific message. As an ensemble in visual, I think it shows an exciting possibility of how variable of the virtual exhibition can be.

Further research for NFT
  
Description

'An NFT is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, which can be sold and traded. The NFT can be associated with a particular digital or physical asset (such as a file or a physical object) and a license to use the asset for a specified purpose. NFTs (and the associated license to use, copy or display the underlying asset) can be traded and sold on digital markets.

NFTs function like cryptographic tokens, but, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, hence not fungible. While all bitcoins are equal, each NFT may represent a different underlying asset and thus have a different value. NFTs are created when blockchains string records of cryptographic hash, a set of characters identifying a set of data, onto previous records therefore creating a chain of identifiable data blocks. This cryptographic transaction process ensures the authentication of each digital file by providing a digital signature that is used to track NFT ownership. However, data links that point to details like where the art is stored can die.'

Uses

'The image, Hashmask 15753 (1 of 16,384) by "Suum Cuique Labs GmbH", sold with an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
The unique identity and ownership of an NFT is verifiable via the blockchain ledger. Ownership of the NFT is often associated with a license to use the underlying digital asset, but generally does not confer copyright to the buyer, some agreements only grant a license for personal, non-commercial use, while other licenses also allow commercial use of the underlying digital asset.'
  
Questions of high and low art, aesthetics, and curation arise when talking about blockchain and art because many in the art world have not been interested in the pixel/glitch/meme look of popular early “crypto art,” represented by the recent beeple sale or the infamous CryptoKitties or CryptoPunks. James Bridle had already made the point around the digital look in his new aesthetics. Blockchain art’s pop aesthetic seemed tied to crypto-currency, especially in its playing card multiples and terms like “collectibles.” In due course, someone will likely contextualise these works in terms of Warhol, Koons, or KAWS. 

Blockchain is inherently distributed, a lack of hierarchy that appeals to many tech idealists but also those looking to widen access to the art world. Dada.art allows people to draw in conversation with each other, responding to each other’s works with another, a different kind of social media. It is free to join and participate. They have made curatorial sets, as for example, the “Creeps & Weirdos” from 2017 that became available for sale as NFTs; even though they had archived the remaining ones, the recent flurry of interest in blockchain art led dedicated buyers to find and buy them. 

The Dada art selection represents how the art world’s engagement with blockchain doesn’t reject some aspects of centralization. Curatorial choice can help guide new audiences as many are overwhelmed when visiting popular NFT sale sites where anyone can post anything they want. Galleries are getting involved now and likely some platforms will focus exclusively on art or have channels that represent curated selections. This doesn’t need to be a rejection of the distributed and decentralised ethos of blockchain as long as these centralising elements act in a decentralised manner.
  
The anxieties provoked by blockchain for many in the art world reveal ongoing problems inherent to the industry. The conversation around artists’ equity, aesthetics, environment, and capital have been a part of the art dialogue for decades and blockchain is forcing confrontation with these issues. The technology is new, misinformation abounds, and recent popular examples have led to ridicule or disdain. We need a more complex conversation around this technology and its potential for art, rather than the reiteration of attitudes from fifty years ago when art’s use of computers and electronics, or its relationship to government and industry was the great travesty.

Homage to Hannah Hock
  
Me and Melissa analised one of the interesting collage from hannah's works called'Grotesk', made in 1963.

My criterion of founding images was at least had one aspect similar with the original one (could be color, texture, shape, content, meaning...) And also to make it became more interesting, I replaced the human legs with animals legs. So the information that I delivered to audience was totally different with the original. (Think about Einstein played with a beauty model who had chicken leg and horse leg)
