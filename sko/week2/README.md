week 2

Research for group pitch

We brainstormed the classification of collage last week, and the most attractive category was the 3d collage for me.

We had three members, after discussed the basic relative information that we needed to share in pitch, we decided to introduce them with 3 categories: the physical sculpture collage, AR collage and purely virtual 3d collage. I started to research the virtual 3d collage within the new media art websites I collected before:

https://www.unsound.pl/en/dp-authentic
https://www.ofluxo.net
https://feralfile.com/exhibitions
https://www.seditionart.com
https://www.hervisions.world

I could find so many amazing digital culture artworks and activities in these platform and when I started to focus on founding the works that relatived with collage, the number surprised me. It's a great result that showed how flexible can collage work with new technology! In the process of browsing these artists, some of them grab my attention: from the theory topic to the visual layouts:

MARIA CASTELLANOS

'The Plant Sense (2018) is one of her latest works designed together with Alberto Valverde with the supports of the VERTIGO project and LABoral Centro de Arte. Duo explores how plants experience and respond to their surroundings by using a wearable device which allows them to receive data from the plant. The Plant Sense makes the communication between human and plants possible and enables us to feel the senses of the plant in our own body. Accordingly, the installation contributes to dissolving of the boundaries between human and nonhuman and shows that we are all detecting changes in our surroundings and responding accordingly. The Posthuman Trial and Error (2016) is another project of Castellanos dealing with beauty ideals in the context of posthuman in the cyborg era. 3D human-scale sculptures explore different ways of looking at the presence and allow us to (re)question and (re)think on how posthuman will be.  Thus, The Posthuman Trial and Error can be seen as an intriguing experiment in bridging the discourses of posthumanism and cyborg experience.'

During her research, I also went deep in Donna Haraway’s feminist theories about the cyborg. “The Cyborg Manifesto” by Haraway was very inspiring for me. With Haraway, I discovered that she had already named that issue that I had always worried me about bodies. Breaking the boundaries, and going beyond the dichotomies human/technology, human/animal, etc. So, I was really fascinated with the connexions between wearables, cyborgs and feminism, I think it mightt be the starting point of my research for final work.

newbody.v1e.revised, José CarlosCasado

'José Carlos Casado newbody.v1e.revised (2004) is a 3D animation of low poly collage figures that he specifies are engaged in an infinite dance where there are no physical boundaries; they do not crash with each other, they literally go inside each other’s bodies. These works present a structure of feeling. That is, they are creations of a sense that slippery figures navigating and negotiating each other is something to explore. '

The colliding virtual collage bodies offer some of the uncanny movements that have been a part of modern and contemporary dance for decades. I thought of Pilobilus Dance that uses flesh-toned leotards, kin to the stripped-down aesthetic cultivated in the digital works. The collage body in motion is what is being shown and revered, and likewise, the creation of the body in motion, in person or virtually—the digital artist’s code manipulations and the computer algorithm act as choreographers. 

Great dance takes my breath away because the body transforms. Seeing it on screen or in person provokes that question posed so eloquently by Yeats: How can we know the dancer from the dance? How can something as tangible as a human body gift me a sense of the ephemeral? How does something evanescent offer a celebration of the physical? This is a liminal time when the virtual and tangible collide.


Analogy text practise

![IMG_7297 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68723373/138879266-8bb0d62e-caaf-4441-9b83-328fe47ff6e8.jpg)

For the actual analogy practise we started to play with text. Basically I used them as a readable word and a element for decoration that crop with various geometrical shapes. Besides, when I deconstructed the alphabet and Chinese characters, alphabet usually became the geometrical shape but Chinese characters were more abstract, suddenly I wondered that if I used those abstract as input elements and created a automatically generative painter, what outcomes I would get?
