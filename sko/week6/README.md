Less festival class brainstorm

I really enjoyed the process that everyone in class energetic shared various ideas toward same goal, same project! We basically had the graphic, motion, 3d virtual, AR, interactive website, games,... I thought those would present diverse perspectives with collage and how less festival promoted the contemporary and futuristic collage for public. When the work we created needed to consider the audience experience, there would have a number of points needed to be concisely designed and made the narrative content followed a understandable logical line or structure. If the artwork was basic on storytelling, maybe a good way to present the video less than 10 minutes with the key action and main visual for a better watching experience. (I sometimes go to the physical art festival and as the audience I don't think I will stand 1 hour to watch a movie, except they provide a comfortable place for watching and I have plenty of time)
