This week we kept exploring the diversity of our band with more layouts and contents. We decided to make the video separately and combined them together as a full clip video. Through my video only had 1:30mins but it still followed the narrative storyline, I visualized the process of the tooth extraction and how painful with that; I used the scalpel speared the teeth to describe that feeling.


Less festival class brainstorm

I really enjoyed the process that everyone in class energetic shared various ideas toward same goal, same project! We basically had the graphic, motion, 3d virtual, AR, interactive website, games,... I thought those would present diverse perspectives with collage and how less festival promoted the contemporary and futuristic collage for public. When the work we created needed to consider the audience experience, there would have a number of points needed to be concisely designed and made the narrative content followed a understandable logical line or structure. If the artwork was basic on storytelling, maybe a good way to present the video less than 10 minutes with the key action and main visual for a better watching experience. (I sometimes go to the physical art festival and as the audience I don't think I will stand 1 hour to watch a movie, except they provide a comfortable place for watching and I have plenty of time)

Research of the similar festival and see how they curated and visualized their content to audience

Event: FEELINGS, a digital exhibition by Synthesis Gallery

As a reflection on the social distancing phenomenon caused by the global pandemic and its consequent influence on individuals and society’s emotional sphere, the synthesis gallery presents FEELINGS, a digital exhibition curated by Jeffrey Grunthaner and George Vitale. Launched on November 19th, 2020 and running through February 21st, 2021, the show features six artists with a heterogeneous practice. Specifically, it brings together works by aaajiao, Matthew Gantt, Claudia Hart, LaJuné McMillian, Martina Menegon and Kathi Schulz. 

The gaze on the intangibility that fills the virtual dimension through the provision of new formats of interaction and togetherness is the red thread binding the displayed works, accessed on Mozilla Hubs. The virtual platform is designed to allow visitors to move and connect within a shared simulated space.

Events and walkthroughs are planned throughout the whole opening period, encouraging participation and accompanying viewers across the virtual space and its inherent applications. The Fountain, a site-specific durational performance composed by Matthew Gantt, is the upcoming appointment that will be live on January 21st at 20:00 CET. It will be available continuously through the following day, simultaneously recorded and subsequently archived. 

For 24 hours, both sonically and visually generative work, conceived as an expansion of the artist’s centrepiece of the show, will shape minimalist forms and aggregations unfolding in a loop of synaesthetic perpetual mutations. Visitors are invited to participate in the event by contributing a sound, thus extending the idea of collectivity that lies at the core of the exhibition’ purpose.

Currently, the value of freedom fostered by the digital world is severely challenged by the impossibility of fully experiencing the world in physical proximity with the multiple others. Virtuality has invaded our daily lives and emotional sphere, delineating a dimension of mediated and filtered exchanges. How our interiority and identities are exposed, communicated and shared fades into perception. Nevertheless, in such a landscape, dwells the potential of activating alternative forms of consciousness and creating communities, FEELINGS takes a step in this direction.
