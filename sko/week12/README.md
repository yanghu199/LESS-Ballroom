week12

We did not have much time in video so I decided to make the ending with a general storyline (bacially just a couple of the keyframes) and the full version of the story (8-10mins) could be done after the submission. As the story planned before, Elena and her husband had a broken marriage

I used the color and darkness to express that

A scene that depicted husband done a trade with a thief, whose mission was to steal the design layouts from Elena.

Elena couldn't bear the situation and she decided to retaliate against all those involved (because she thinks they are the source of her narcissistic delusions); her tears corroded their dresses - they always hided from to present their reality personality and thoughts and wore them as a mask. 

I will continue to refine the full story in November...

Reflection of the whole semester

It's a wonderful journey with Karen and other classmates; we started with collage, but end with the results which were far away more than collage. I was so enjoyed the process of building and refining a project from 0 to a specific outcome. The comprehensive research, which I thought was one of the important and useful things that Karen taught us, includes the theories study(professional book,essay,report…),relevant commentaries(news,report,critical article), relevant artworks(paintings, installations, photographs, sculptures, movies…), were greatly improved the progress of creating the visual elements. It provides a logical and systematic perspectives for a complicated topic, especially in thhe initial stage, it’s difficult to find an appropriate entry point to start the whole visual journey. I think I have already found myself applying these academic critical thinking methods in my master’s degree application portfolio and it’s gradually looking more professional and mature now.
