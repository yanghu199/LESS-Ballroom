After last week's pitch I had a better understanding of what other were focus on and we all had our own perspective of promotional works --- some of them were merchandise like hoodies, t-shirt, and some of them were graphics like poster, branding, publication... One of them were really inspired me; Christina mentioned that to combine the virtual fashion with collage in an application. It let me started to imagine that if I could make the tower became a virtual collageg fashion show as well? Besides I was still wondering the function that interactived with audience, wander was the best method or there was other better then that? If I was one of the audience, would I lost patience when I was not quite familiar with controls the 3d view with keyboard? There were still many questions and posibilities for me to consider.

Moodboard for virtual fashion show

Collage practise

- Make the same cutup experiments you did for the 'homage to Burroughs' and do these with pages of images (ie. cut the page into quarters and rearrange, cut into eights and so on.) 
- use a few pages cut into eighths, pluck and arrange at random. Repeat. repeat again, try to capture (photograph) any interesting juxtapositions.
- Slice two images into 20 strips (either horizontally or vertically) be careful to keep in order at first. Arrange the images alternating strips (pic A slice 1, picB slice 1, pic A slice 2 and so on.) Experiment with regards to the width of your strip, or the direction. what happens if you don't realign the images perfectly? What if you skip strips picA 1, picB 2, picA 3 etc..?

I followed the instruction that Karen gave us in canvas first, experimented with the full text page and some pages with images. When I attempted to crop the image into the thin strips, it gave me a sense of the bamboo chip and I could use them to weave a image net.
