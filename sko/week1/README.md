 week 1
 
 A new semester with Karen again!I was so excited to use collage in various fields like combining with virtual components, or interactived with reality... It just had so many interesting possibles for me to explore as collage is one of my favourite visual tools. Also this studio was special, it set up for a contemporary collage festival so we can have some valuable opportunities to have connection with real world activity, which was really difficult in this time (everything runs in virtual and as a student, I haven't done the commercial design for a real client... I only finished a several of interns before so really seek for real world experience)
 
 As the first class we started with introduced ourself with a couple of items that can consider to represent ourself. I liked this kind of 3d sculpture collage introduction because it's more directly to see everyone's common interests.

I selected the game controller, instant coffee, gudetama toy and a little bottle of whisky. After came back to home and started online course, I barely had social activities with friends and gradually lost connection with real world. Sometimes I felt like I was the character who lived in virtual game and just sometimes needed to jump out to take class in another world.

But this situation needed to change. Keep learning new technique, having new friends, new fab artworks will provide energy. Karen provided two articles (https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/collage-artists/wangechi-mutu ; https://towardsdatascience.com/we-are-collage-e2c27a6198b2) for the quick start introduction of the history and famous artists of collage. How's the previous form of collage, and what kind of evaluation that the new technical will provide for collage? How did those contemporary artists used this tool to express their emotion and thought?

Researched and understood the previous 2d collages was necessarily because those were the foundation of building the new creation. Everytime we believed that we created someting brand new yet actually someone already created that with different forms or had similar ideas before. After class, I researched collage contemporary artwork in museum' web like tate, Guggenheim, the Met... (effective way for browsing the relative artworks and also they had detail background introduction)(https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/collage ; https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/birds-of-a-feather ; https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/learn/schools/teachers-guides/experimental-techniques => Jean-Michel Basquiat' s activities for his class :

Cut-ups

Basquiat often used the “cut-up” technique to emulate the writing process of American writer William S. Burroughs (b. 1914, St. Louis, Missouri; d. 1997, Lawrence, Kansas). This consisted of reorganizing a text to produce a new one from it. He drew inspiration from everything around him, mixing materials together, cutting them up, and organizing it again to form new images.

Give each student a photocopy of Eroica (1987). Have them cut out the sign, symbol, or splash of paint that most interests them.

Every cut-out will be stuck on a piece of paper or cloth like a mural, creating a collage and reorganizing the artwork into something new. The students can paint on the glued cut-outs with tempera or acrylic paint to structure the composition.

When they have finished, compare Basquiat’s work with the new one they have created. What fresh contributions or different meanings do they find in the new painting?


From the street to the artwork

Organize an outing with your students. Go with them through an area of your town or city in search of signs, words, or phrases. Each student should bring a notebook to jot down what they find. They can also take photos.

Back in the classroom, students will make lists with the words and signs they have found. Ask them to invent a symbol for each of the words found, and a meaning for each of the signs.

Make photocopies of the lists that have been formed and their symbols, and ask the students to cut them up.

Ask students to find pieces of used wood or cardboard to act as a support for a painting. Each student will prepare their support by painting it with acrylic paint. Then they will stick and superimpose on it the photocopied words individually or as phrases, together with the drawings and symbols related to them. Encourage students to add strokes of paint and other drawings suited to the theme emerging from the work. Use acrylic paint, paintbrushes of different widths, crayons, felt-tip pens, glue, etc.

When they have finished, organize an exhibition to observe the results. Think about the connections they find between the artworks and the city or town they live in.


Music

Choose three different songs or pieces of music for your students: one classical piece, another jazz, and the third rap.

Without revealing the titles, ask students to draw or paint something inspired by each one as they are listening to it. Encourage them to paint abstract forms and use colors to express feelings and emotions.

Put the drawings on a classroom wall grouped by the different pieces of music, and try to find possible connections within each group. Generate potential stories by revealing the musical titles.

Mix up the paintings and drawings from the different pieces of music and try to find new sensations that could emerge from the mixture.

Which of all the responses do they find most interesting? Have them discuss their opinions.
