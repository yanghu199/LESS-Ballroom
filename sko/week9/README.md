week9

This week was absolutely a whole brand new starting point for me, and Christina; we decided to work together! We had a really quick conversation regarding the ways of cooperation, Christina wanted to combine our work we had now together but I thought maybe it was better to create a new one. New topic, new layout, new function. Then we started with the basic question - what was it? How did it work?

We started to research a number of scenario designs in drama, opera, musical, movie... In order to learn and absorb their color palette (how to use color to reflect character's mood and personal characteristics? ) lighting (some scenario are really simple but they use lighting to fill up the empty space; also they use lighting motion to create atmosphere)

SUSPIRIA 1977

A phantasmagoria of unnatural colors and only slightly less unnatural situations, Suspiria remains Italian horror maestro Dario Argento’s finest achievement. His beautifully conceived aesthetic approach triumphs over the necessity for dramatic context, creating an experience that proves haunting because of how its colors and sounds tap into our unconscious, as opposed to our emotional identification with the narrative. Arranged in splashes of primary colors that illuminate every scene, the film’s visual boldness is not interested in hues and shades; rather, Argento employs solid, pure colors to hyperbolic effect. It’s a film entrenched in poetic reasoning and the power of image, and within those limitations, it proves engaging as a sensory experience, but not a logical or emotionally satisfying one. Indeed, Argento refuses to conform to traditional methods of storytelling, shot for shot logic, tonal consistency, or matters of characterization that might create a bond between the film and its audience. We were so inspired by the aesthetic and creepy atmosphere in this movie and also how Argento pushed the story line with defocus transition and lighting changing. I decided to attempt to use lighting change to express the emotion and different situations in my video. 

The voice thief 2013

Surreal, fetishistic, iconoclastic and rich with the craziest of details, The Voice Thief is a type of film rarely seen these days, like an unholy cross between Alejandro Jodorowsky's wildest and weirdest ideas, Dario Argento's most baroque horrors and Nicolas Winding Refn's stylish provocations. Its lavish colors and textures, the eccentric costumes and tastefully kitschy sets are wonderfully captured by the keen eye of DP Alexis Zabe (who collaborated with Reygadas on Stellet Licht and Post Tenebras Lux) in a long series of breathtaking visual compositions. The flamboyantly kaleidoscopic aesthetics are complemented by the French musician Rob's 80s-sounding score. We were so impressed by the extravagant and magnificent style of the dresses and scenario design.

Text setting

To replenish the specific content of our storyline of the project background, we started to write a simple playscript and the introduction of each character.(of course it related with the main topic we wanted to discuss in the whole project and it needed more deeper research, but the direction was the relationship between fashion and identity, characteristic, mask, catalyst, desire...)

Function setting

We decided to use the website as a container for our work. I thought the essence of Chirstina's initial AR application was actually a interactive dressup game, so I imagined that if it's possible to make a dressup game in web with unity or three.js? Instead of the player dressed the garment themself, the virtual model would replace them and player could select the style of the garment and also the texture.
