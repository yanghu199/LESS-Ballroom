class activity - Book Spine Poems in homage to Nina Katchadourian

Nina Katchadourian - Sorted Books project

'The Sorted Books project began in 1993, and it has has taken place on many different sites over the years, ranging form private homes to specialized book collections. The process is the same in every case: I sort through a collection of books, pull particular titles, and eventually group the books into clusters so that the titles can be read in sequence. The final results are shown either as photographs of the book clusters or as the actual stacks themselves, often shown on the shelves of the library they came from. Taken as a whole, the clusters are a cross-section of that library's holdings that reflect that particular library's focus, idiosyncrasies, and inconsistencies. They sometimes also function as a portrait of the particular book owner. The Sorted Books project is an ongoing project which I add to almost each year, and there there are hundreds of images in the ongoing archive to date.'

I haven't attempted to use book spine to create text collage before so it was pretty newfangled to combine some English book with Chinese. 'pool journal cereal eclipse Mont Sainte-Victoir' was the translation of my book spine poems. It's a pity that I don't have enough physical books otherwise I can try more possibilities with them. (if I can play this in kindle that will be funny)

Band practise - Dentist Killer

When started to built the basic information for our own band, 'dentist killer' was just jumped in my mind (maybe because I watched the Korean drama 'Hell is Other People' recently and the hero was a dentist and a serial killer). Dentist killer is a band that focus on dark trap music and experimental electronic, the natural fear to dentist and the tooth extraction is where our inspiration comes from. We use fear and agony as the guideline of our creation of exploring the extremity of emotinal body and sensory organs.

Basic on the horror sense of the band, I created some posters and album covers that visualized the painful of the tooth extraction and imitated the funny text from meme.


LESS festival

After the band practise I started to brainstorm my contribution for less festival. What category should I focus on? What kind of content will be better for promoting the collage culture? And what kind of tools is the suitable one for achieving the result? Within these questions, I decided to continue the direction of my research in pitch and explored the appropriate way to integrate the 3d elements with less collage.

Samples: The BLOB of Im/Possible Images

Imagine you could obtain an 'impossible' image of any object or phenomenon that you think is important, with no limits on spatial, temporal, energy, signal/noise or cost resolutions. What image would you create? (the answer can be a hypothetical image of course!)

This was the question I asked every scientist I spoke to during my Arts at CERN/Collide Barcelona residency. In the BLOB I am presenting some of the insights this research has opened up to me.

The BLOB (Binary Large OBject) gives a home to the collection of Im/Possible images that all together illustrate the concept of the impossible image and the relationships between affordance, resolution and compromise.

As different Axes of Affordance (X,Y,Z and α) cut the BLOB, they define what is possible to resolve, and what images are compromised, or in other words, will never be rendered. While normally these compromised images would never find their way to our eyes, the hypothetical realms of the BLOB offer pasture to these impossible renders.

Via the open call you can submit your own Im/Possible image. These images might be considered for implementation and exhibition.

The BLOB of Im/Possible Images is made in commission for Haus der elektronischen Künste Basel (HEK)

Leymusoom - an online exhibition for artist Heesoo Leymusoom Kwon

In 2017 I initiated and autobiographical feminist religion, Leymusoom, as an ever-evolving exploration of my family histories and feminist liberation. Through this, I produced 3d animated video and interactive games of real and imagined worlds, populated by avatars of my female ancestors, living in 3d environments from actual locations or spaces from my life and family history.

Leymusoom Digital Shrine is an interactive digital archive of me and my family’s memories which become portals for hyperspace travel, inviting the viewers to explore the mhihstory of Leymusoom and the utopian world that I am envisioning. It reincarnated my female ancestors’ lives and Leymusoom communal spaces without constraints of time and space.
